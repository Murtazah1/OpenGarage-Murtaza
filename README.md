## 🎉 welcome

hello there! 👋 welcome to **OpenGarage**, my very first attempted contribution to the world of **free and open-source software**. i am building this project to provide simple tools that everyone can use freely, modify, and share. this journey marks the beginning of my adventure into creating software for the community. i hope you'll find these tools helpful and maybe even join me in improving them as well as our skills as developers! 🚀

**OpenGarage** is all about practicality, freedom, ... and no ads! it will offer small, useful tools for common tasks, such as video conversion, encoding text, and image manipulation, and anything i learn along the way. all software here is provided under the mit license—because software should be free, accessible, and shareable.

**adhd yapping**
for some reason, i often forget that i have the knowledge and tools available for a certain issue. yet, i find myself looking up websites to convert .mp4 to .gif, then i have to sign up, agree to their terms of service, agree to forced arbitration... it's exhausting. this is me, a fresh college graduate, who everyday realizes how much i do not know, fighting back against this modern idea of learned helplessness that has slightly been creeping in. i will make mistakes and i encourage anyone to correct and teach me, whether you be a high school competitive programmer, or an elderly beginner programmer. anyone can provide you with a learning opportunity <3

## ✨ what's inside?

OpenGarage currently plans to offer a collection of simple utilities that i already have used:

- **video file converters:**
  - mp4 to gif converter
  - webm to mp4 converter
- **encoding tools:**
  - run-length encoding (rle) utility
- **..coming soon!**

## 🚀 how to get started

i've tried to make this project as easy as possible to use!

### 1. clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/brespina/OpenGarage.git
cd OpenGarage
```

### 2. set up a virtual environment

it's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies for this project. here's how to set it up:

#### for windows

```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\scripts\activate
```

#### for macOS and linux

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### FIXME: EXPLAIN CHOCO -> SCOOP -> PIPX -> PIPX INSTALL POETRY vs PIP INSTALL POETRY TOMORROw 10/13/2024

### X. install dependencies - note

***note: i am learning how to use pyproject.toml and its proving difficult for me but it seems vastly worth it.***

- **(i still am unsure if i set this up properly. i am reading poetry documentation, along with pre-commit, pre-commit-ci, black, and flake8)**
now that your virtual environment is activated, install the required packages:

```bash
# good bye requirements.txt pip install -r requirements.txt
poetry install
```

### 4. run a tool

here are examples of how to use one of the tools on different operating systems:

#### convert a .webm to .mp4

##### running tool in windows

```bash
cd tools\video_converters\webm_to_mp4
python webm_to_mp4.py -ip c:\absolute\path\to\input\video.webm -of output_name.mp4
```

##### running tool in macOS and linux

```bash
cd tools/video_converters/webm_to_mp4
python3 webm_to_mp4.py -ip /absolute/path/to/input/video.webm -of output_name.mp4
```

the result will be placed in the respective child output folder.
